"""Recompute echoes and evidence states in saved replays, from cached data only.

Echoes used to count any earlier token a buyer bought soon after deployment. They now count
only launches whose deployment and T0 resolved and whose 6 h launch window contained the buy.
Launch Reflex scores do not change, so this rewrites the echo event and the state of buyers
we could not score. Makes no API calls: a cache miss is reported, never guessed.
